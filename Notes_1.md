> Why python language?

**Python is a beginner-friendly and highly versatile programming language, making it easy to learn and implement across various domains.** From web development and automation to data science and machine learning, Python is used virtually everywhere. Its clean syntax and vast ecosystem of libraries make it suitable for both simple tasks and complex projects.

In real-life applications, Python can help you:

- **Organize your digital files**: Automatically sort documents, photos, videos, and other files into appropriate folders based on type, name, or creation date.
    
- **Automate repetitive tasks**: Clean temporary files, rename batches of files, or schedule regular backups of important data.
    
- **Build intelligent tools**: Create your own AI agents or chatbots using frameworks like `LangChain`, `OpenAI API`, or `Rasa`.
    
- **Detect faces or objects**: Use OpenCV to build face detection systems or security monitoring apps.
    
- **Scrape data from websites**: Collect product data, reviews, or prices from sites like Amazon or Flipkart using libraries like `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, or `Selenium`.
    
- **Analyze and visualize data**: Use `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` to process and visualize large datasets for insights and decision-making.
    
- **Create web apps**: Develop scalable web applications using frameworks like `Django` or `Flask`.
    
- **Develop games**: Use `Pygame` to build 2D games for learning and entertainment.
    
- **Build desktop applications**: Use `Tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `Kivy` to create user-friendly software interfaces.
    
- **Control IoT devices**: Integrate Python with Raspberry Pi to automate home appliances or build smart home solutions.
    
- **Automate browser actions**: Fill out forms, log into accounts, and perform web tasks with `Selenium` or `Playwright`.
    
- **Monitor stock prices or cryptocurrencies**: Pull real-time financial data and automate trading strategies.
    

For example, if your friend asks for a list of the best laptops under $5000, you can write a Python script to scrape laptop listings from Amazon or Flipkart, extract details like price, brand, and features, and save the results in an Excel file using the `openpyxl` or `pandas` library to share easily.

#### **Course FAQs:**

> **_Note: Many of these FAQs pertain to Notebooks, Anaconda, and Python. All of which we will discuss in Section 2 with video content. We have videos going over all about Python and the installation process. This FAQ is just here as a reference for you to visit whenever you wish. If you want to continue with the course and the install procedure, continue on to the next lecture. Thanks!_**

**1. Where can I find the Jupyter Notebooks for the Course?** The course is now in Python 3, but still have the older Python 2 notebooks available for reference in case you need them.

Python 3 Notebooks can be found here:

[https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp)  
  

The older Python 2 Notebooks can be found here:

[https://github.com/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp](https://github.com/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp)  

**2. How do I download the Notebooks? (We show this in a video in the next section)**

You can go to the GitHub page linked above and then click the _download zip_ button to download all the notebook (.ipynb) files onto your computer (compressed as a zip file, you'll need to unzip it). Check out the lecture "Getting the Notebooks" for a video guide to this.

**3. How do I know what directory my Notebooks are being saved?**

To find out where your notebooks are type: **pwd** in a cell and run it with Shift+Enter. This will print your working directory.

**4. How can I change where the Notebooks are being saved?**

You will need to change the directory in which you are starting you jupyter notebook. Use **cd** in the terminal or command prompt to change to your desired directory if you are running jupyter notebook at your command line. Alternatively, just navigate to your desired directory using the Anaconda Navigator as described in the lecture "Running Python Code".

**5. How do I open .ipynb files? What program do I choose? (We show this in a video in the next section)**

After installing Anaconda, search your computer for Anaconda Navigator, then launch jupyter notebook and move through the Jupyter Notebook interface until you reach your desired directory where you have your .ipynb files. Please note, you can not just double click a .ipynb file, it won't open that way.

Using Juptyer Notebook at your command line? Here are the instructions to open .ipynb files through your command line:

In order to open the Notebook Files you'll need to have Python and the Jupyter Notebook system installed, check out the Python Set-up section for more details on the installation of Python and the Jupyter Notebook system (or you can just follow the relevant instructions [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) if you feel more technical). Once you have python and the jupyter notebooks installed you are ready to open the notebooks using the following steps:  

1. First open up your Command Prompt (search for **cmd** on a Windows machine) or if you are on a Mac use your terminal (Spotlight search for **terminal**).
    
2. Next in you terminal/command prompt type **pwd** and press enter (this will print your working directory)
    
3. Take note of what file directory was displayed, this is where you should save your **.ipynb** files (or a folder containing your **.ipynb** files)
    
4. Once your **ipynb** files or folder containing the files is in the location displayed from the **pwd** step go back to your terminal and type **jupyter notebook** and press Enter.
    
5. After Step 4 you should have a browser tab open up with the Jupyter Notebook system running inside of it.
    
6. Click on your Notebook (or go to your folder of Notebooks) displayed in the Jupyter Notbeook and it will open in a new tab with the Notebook you selected.
    
7. You should now have successfully opened a Notebook file.
    

**6. How do I get my certification?**

Check out Udemy's official link on this (we don't control certification).

# Command line argument

**This allow you to programmatically move through your computer's directory. This include:**
1. Find your current directory
	> Type `cd` to know your current directory.
2. List all files in directory
	> Type `dir` to check every files, directory in your current directory.
3. How to change directory
	> Type `cd YourDirectoryName`. Example, if you been in `C:\India` and you wanna jump into `States` directory, you can do it by typing `cd States`. `cd` stands for **change directory**. If you are too lazy to type you can type `cd FirstLetterOFYourDirectory` and press `Tab` button on your keyboard, this will suggest you your letter matching directory.
4. How to clear command line screen
	> Type `cls` to clear your cluttered console.
5. How to get back one step back from directory?
	> Type `cd ..`, you can exit one directory.

# Variable Assignment

Variable assignments means assigning name, number, string to variable. For example, if you have name called *Rohit* that means *Rohit* name assigned to you when you get born. Similarly in programming language assigning value to variable useful for future use.

## Example 1:

```python
name="Rohit"
age=21
weight=65.80
```

## Rules for variable names

1. Variable cannot start with number.
    > `1stName="Rohit"` :no_entry_sign:
    
2. Spaces not allowed.
    > `first name="Rohit"` :no_entry_sign:
    
3.  Keywords not allowed.
    > `if="Rohit"` :no_entry_sign:
    

`Python` language is dynamic type, so you can assign different value to single variable in different lines. For example, you want to assign `Tommy` name to `dogName` variable, if you change your mind, you can assign `12` number to `dogName`.

## Example:

```python
dogName="Tommy"
dognName=15
```

Above code is error free. If you try this in `C++` language it gives error.

> **Note:** `type()` function used to show data type of variable. [Data Types](#data-types-in-python)

---
# Strings

String is collection of characters. It can your name, address, pet name etc. Written in single quote(`''`) or double quote (`""`). For example `name='Ramesh'` or `name="Ramesh"`. Strings are ordered sequences so it can be accessed through indexing. Indexing start from `0` to `n-1`. Negative indexing also exist in python language. To access particular character from string you can use `[]` square brackets. For example `myName[0]`. `myName` variable contains `Rohit` string if you print `myName[0]` this would result `R`, because `R` is stored ar `0` index. If you give negative index like `-10`, `-20`, this would print character from back to front. For example:

```python
myName="Rohit"
print(myName[-1]) # Output: t
```

Here output would be `t`, because negative indexing start from `-1`.

## Example:

```python
name="Rohit"
print(name[0]) # Output: R
print(name[-1]) # Output: t
```

## Top 10 String methods.

1. `upper()` Convert all characters into uppercase.
```python
name="rohit"
print(name.upper()) # Output: ROHIT
```
2. `lower()` Converts all characters in lower case.
```python
name="ROHIT"
print(name.lower()) # Output: rohit
```
3. `strip()` Removes leading(starting) & trailing(Ending) whitespaces.
```python
name="    Rohit    "
print(name.strip()) # Output: Rohit
```
4. `replace("old","new")` Replace all occurence of substring with another.
```python
name="Rohit"
print(name.replace("R","M")) # Output: Mohit
```
5. `split(separator)` Split the string into list of substring. `separator` can be`,`, `.`, ` `.
```python
name="Rohit,Sharma"
nameList=name.split(",")
print(nameList) # Output: ["Rohit", "Sharma"]
print(type(nameList)) # Output: <class 'list'>
```

6. `join(iterable)` Joins elements of an iterable into single string.
```python
source="D:/Country"
myFolderLocation="States"
fullPath="/".join([source, myFolderLocation])
print(fullPath) # Output: D:/Country/States
print(type(fullPath)) # Output: <class 'str'>
```

7. `find(substring)` Returns the lowest index where the substring is found, or `-1` if not found. If string contains `Rohit Roshan`, only first occurence of character's index value returned. You can see in the example.
```python
name="RohitRoshan"
print(name.find("R")) # Output: 0
print(name.find("d")) # Output: -1
```

8. `startswith(prefix)` Check if the string starts with a specified substring. It returns `boolean` value.
```python
name="Rohit"
print(name.startswith("R")) # Output: True
fullName="Rohit Sharma"
print(fullName.startswith("Rohit")) # Output: True
print(fullName.startswith("Sharma")) # Output: False
```

9. `endswith(suffix)` Check if the string ends with a specified substring.
```python
name="Rohit"
print(name.endswith("t")) # Output: True
fullName="Rohit Sharma"
print(fullName.endswith("Rohit")) # Output: False
print(fullName.endswith("Sharma")) # Output: True
```

10. `isdigit()` Returns `True` if all characters in the string are **Digits**.
```python
age="20"
print(age.isdigit()) # Output: True
```

---

How to extract `hit` from `Rohit` string in python? Well, you can do it by slicing string. Slicing means cutting the main string into substring for you own use.

### Syntax:

```python
string[startIndex: EndIndex: Step]
```

### Example:

```python
name="Rohit"
print(name[2:5]) # Output: hit
```
If you observe carefully you would notice that `endIndex` is 5 but `5th` index's character not get printed. This happen due to string index start from `0`. `Step` is optional. If you don't mention `startInndex` then it consider `0` as default. If you don't mention `endIndex` then it consider `n-1` or `lastWord` as default.

> **Note:** `String[::]` means start from `0` index to `n-1` index.

# Print formatting with String.

```python
name="Rohit"
print(name) # Output: Rohit
```

In the above example just name being displayed; what if you wanna add `Hello Rohit` instead of `Rohit`? This done by `formating`. See the below example:

```python
name="Rohit"
print("Hello",name) # Output: Hello Rohit
```

Another way to do this (**recommended**):

```python
name="Rohit"
print(f"Hello {name}") # Output: Hello Rohit
```

> The `f` stands for **f-string**, which is short for **formatted string literal** — a powerful way to embed variables or expressions directly inside strings.

# Float Formatting with f-strings

You can control the **number of decimal places**, **alignment**, and more using **format specifiers** inside `{}`.

What's the answer of `12/7`? Answer is `1.714286`. This number is too long to print onto console, however you can crop it by following method and result would be `1.7142` or how much decimal point you want, it arbitrary choice.

```python
value = 1.714286
print(f"Value is {value:.2f}")  # Output: Value is 1.71
```

**Explanation:**

- `:.2f` means:
    
    - `:` → Start format spec
        
    - `.2` → 2 decimal places. If you type `.4` answer would be `1.7142`
        
    - `f` → Fixed-point number (float)

# List

`List` are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types. They use square brackets `[]` and commas `,` to separate object in the `list`. Example `List=[1,"A","Hello"]`. `List` support *indexing* & *slicing*. `List` can be nested & also have a variety of useful methods.

# Top 10 Python List Methods


## 1. `append(item)`  
   - **Description**: Adds an item to the end of the list.  
   - **Example**:

# Dictionary

A **Dictionary** in Python is an unordered, mutable, and indexed collection of key-value pairs. It is defined using curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` constructor.  

## Key Features:  
- **Unordered** – Elements are not stored in any particular order.  
- **Mutable** – Can be modified after creation.  
- **Indexed by Keys** – Values are accessed using unique keys (not by position).  
- **No Duplicate Keys** – Each key must be unique; duplicate keys overwrite existing values.  
- **Heterogeneous** – Keys and values can be of any data type.  

## Syntax:  
```python
my_dict = {key1: value1, key2: value2, ...}
# or
my_dict = dict(key1=value1, key2=value2, ...)
```

## Example:  
```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 21,
    "courses": ["Math", "Physics"]
}

print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice
print(student["courses"][0]) # Output: Math

## Common Dictionary Methods:  
| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| `keys()` | Returns all keys | `student.keys()` → `dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'courses'])` |
| `values()` | Returns all values | `student.values()` → `dict_values(['Alice', 21, ['Math', 'Physics']])` |
| `items()` | Returns key-value pairs | `student.items()` → `dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 21), ...])` |
| `get(key, default)` | Safely retrieves a value | `student.get("grade", "N/A")` → `"N/A"` |
| `update()` | Updates dictionary with new key-values | `student.update({"grade": "A"})` |
| `pop(key)` | Removes a key and returns its value | `student.pop("age")` → `21` |

## Use Cases:  
- Storing data in a structured way (e.g., JSON-like objects)  
- Fast lookups (O(1) average time complexity)  
- Counting occurrences (e.g., word frequency)  

## Important Notes:  
⚠ Keys must be **immutable** (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).  
⚠ Lists cannot be used as keys (they are mutable).
